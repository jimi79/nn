ok, that link is bad. The way that would work would be node spawning a process each time, which is badbadbadbadbadbadbadbad

pyhon object shelve 
or a db
or pickle file in tmp
ahlala

i could have everythg in a db too, but that seems pretty bad, doesn't it


well, i need to save everythg though, meaning the whole matrice. pfff how annoying.
Plus that means that i need to find a way to define all possibles actions in one command line.

And define what to save. About NN make sure that you don't randomize uselesssly synapses if available as a file.

I don't know yet what is the best way : tcp server with a specific coding.
wait, best is http server that does REST, and define 3 methodes : define, query, remember.

Although i need to save from time to time too. and i think i'll stick to pickle.



and the qlearning will just import nn. the qlearning function will save the nn itself, because qlearning uses nn.
